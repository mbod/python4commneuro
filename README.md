## Practical Python Programming for doing Communication Neuroscience

Matthew Brook O'Donnell (mbod@asc.upenn.edu)   


### Overview

This course aims to provide basic programming skills in Python with a focus
on applications to research in communication neuroscience. It covers an
introduction and overview of the Python programming language, data structures and
common Python idioms used for writing simple scripts to access, transform and
analyze data. These basics are then applied to:

* the design of experimental tasks using PsychoPy
* the analysis of log data from PsychoPy tasks and Qualtrics surveys
* analyzing data and producing figures with Pandas and Matplotlib
* using the emergent set of Python tools for neuroimaging including nilearn, nistats and nipype 	


### Some specific topics to be covered will include:

* enough basic Python to get going
* accessing directories and files
* processing text files
* processing Qualtrics survey files
* processing log files from PsychoPy
* working with CSV files using Pandas
* plotting graphs with Matplotlib and Seaborn
* working with matrices using NumPy
* working with Matlab files using scipy.io
* using r2py to interact with R from Python and IPython
* displaying NIFTI files and t-maps using nilearn
* GLM analysis using nistats 
* GLM analysis using nipype
* Connectivity analysis using nilearn
* MVPA analysis using nilearn
* ISC analysis
* How do I do X in Python that I do with Y in R/Matlab?
