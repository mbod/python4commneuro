## Practical Python Programming for doing Communication Neuroscience

### Overview

This course aims to provide basic programming skills in Python with a focus
on applications to research in communication neuroscience. It covers an
introduction and overview of the Python programming language, data structures and
common Python idioms used for writing simple scripts to access, transform and
analyze data. These basics are then applied to:

* the design of experimental tasks using PsychoPy
* the analysis of log data from PsychoPy tasks and Qualtrics surveys
* analyzing data and producing figures with Pandas and Matplotlib
* using the emergent set of Python tools for neuroimaging including nilearn, nistats and nipype
